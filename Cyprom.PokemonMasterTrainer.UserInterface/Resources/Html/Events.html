		<h2>Event Cards</h2>
		<p>
			On your journey, you will encounter many events. But unlike item cards, event cards cannot be saved in a bag.
			When you draw an event card, the event instantly happens. Here is a list of possible events:

		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="Images/TeamRocket.png" alt="Team Rocket" width="150" /></td>
				<td>
					<dl>
						<dt>Team Rocket</dt>
						<dd>
							You run into Team Rocket and free the Pok&eacute;mon they have stolen. As thanks, one of those Pok&eacute;mon joins your team.
							Take any face up Pok&eacute;mon on the field of the same color of the space you are standing on (no roll required).
							If there are no possibilities for your color, it means Team Rocket got away and you get nothing.
						</dd>
					</dl>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="Images/PokemonCenter.png" alt="Pokemon Center" width="150" /></td>
				<td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="Images/Trade.png" alt="TradeStarted" width="150" /></td>

					<dl>
						<dt>TradeStarted</dt>
						<dd>
							Give up one of your Pok&eacute;mon and select an other trainer's Pok&eacute;mon of the same color to get in return.
							Starters cannot be traded. If there are no possible trades, this card becomes useless.
