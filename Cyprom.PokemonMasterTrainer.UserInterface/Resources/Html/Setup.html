		<h1>Setup</h1>
		
		<h2>Board</h2>
		<p>
			The board is loaded with its initial Pok&eacute;mon chips. Random chips are placed on the board on the foreseen spots with their corresponding color.
			Not all chips will be in play, but they can be added later on. The exception are yellow chips. All 5 legendary Pok&eacute;mon are placed in the Dungeon of Legends.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Cards</h2>
		<p>
			All item and event cards are shuffled and held on the side of the board.
			The elite trainer cards are shuffled as well, but they are placed in the center of Indigo Plateau.
			This completes the preparation of the game.
