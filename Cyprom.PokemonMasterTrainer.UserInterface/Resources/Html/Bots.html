		<h1>Bots</h1>
		
		<h2>Players or bots?</h2>
		<p>
			A physical board game is only any good when there are multiple players.
			Of course, a computer game is a lot of fun with other players as well, but sometimes it's just not possible to get several people together to play.
			That's why bots were introduced. Because this digital version of the game is played on a computer, we can let the computer play and compete against us.
			When starting a new game, you can click the human player icons on the player selection screen to turn them into bots. The first player has to be human though.
			It is possible to play with 2 humans and a single bot, or even just a head to head match between 1 human and 1 bot. Try the different combinations, play as you see fit.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
		<p>
			Bots are computer players, so they only have limited &quot;artificial&quot; intelligence.
			Playing against bots may be easier than playing against other humans, since bots may tend to do strange and unlogical things.
			On the other side, bots have no feelings and no remorse. If you are ahead, they will target you and do whatever they think is necessary, regardless of the consequences.
