		<h1>Evolutions</h1>
		
		<h2>Evolving</h2>
		<p>
			Some Pok&eacute;mon evolve into stronger forms. As this game is set up however, you will never actually evolve any of your Pok&eacute;mon.
			Here, you can only get an evolution bonus if you obtain Pok&eacute;mon in the same line of evolution.
			This bonus comes in the form of attack damage for the higher level Pok&eacute;mon.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Set of Two</h3>
		<p>
			If you collect both Pok&eacute;mon in an evolution line of 2, the evolution bonus is +3 for the second Pok&eacute;mon.
			For example: if you have both Pikachu and Raichu, Raichu's attack damage is boosted to 9!

		<h3>Set of Three</h3>
		<p>
			If you collect all three Pok&eacute;mon in an evolution line of 3, the evolution bonus is +5 for the highest Pok&eacute;mon.
			In case you only have 2 out of 3 or you use the second in line, then a bonus of +2 is given.
			For example: If you have Pidgey and Pidgeotto, Pidgeotto's attack damage is boosted to 6.
			If you have Pidgeotto and Pidgeot, Pidgeot's attack damage is boosted to 8.
			If you get hold of all three, Pidgeotto's attack is boosted to 6, but Pidgeot gets a total damage of 11!
