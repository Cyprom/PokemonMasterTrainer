		<h1>Spaces</h1>
		
		<h2>Cities and Towns</h2>
		<p>
			Cities and Towns allow multiple players to stand together.
			In most of them, you will have the chance to draw 2 item cards.
			In a select few, you can use a Pok&eacute;mon Center to revive knocked out Pok&eacute;mon.
			Either revive a single Pok&eacute;mon (guaranteed) or try to roll higher than a 4 to revive all of them.

		<h2>Catch!</h2>
		<p>
			When you land on a &quot;Catch!&quot; space, you are in luck. It's time to catch a Pok&eacute;mon!
			Click the chip next to the space you're on and the Pok&eacute;mon will be revealed.
			For details on how to actually catch it, go to the <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a> page.

		<h2>Event</h2>
		<p>
			When you land on an &quot;Event&quot; space, draw an event card from the pile.
			This card triggers a certain event and may affect other players as well.
