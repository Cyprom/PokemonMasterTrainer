		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		
		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to the world of Pok&eacute;mon!
			<br />Unfortunately, the world of Pok&eacute;mon is not real, and so the sentence above is often heard in a digital environment.
			However, Pok&eacute;mon Master Trainer is a board game that can be physically obtained. This introduction will explain the concept and changes made in this digital version.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Original Game</h2>
		<p>
			The game consists of a board on which Pok&eacute;mon, represented as &quot;chips&quot;, are placed.
			Players move around on the board, trying to win these chips and thus capture Pok&eacute;mon.
			Event and item cards add more functionalities and possibilities to make the game more interesting.
			As the players move from their starting position towards their goal, the encountered Pok&eacute;mon become stronger.
			Players can not only catch Pok&eacute;mon, but they can trade or battle among each other as well.
			In the end, the strongest will be victorious.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Modifications</h2>
		<p>
			The original board game had several flaws and inconsistencies. Though not all of them were fixed in this version, some changes have been made to keep everything more balanced.
			The most important changes are listed below:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Only 3 starter Pok&eacute;mon (and only 3 players) instead of 6. Let's be honest, you do not want to start out with Clefairy or Meowth...</li>
			<li>A better spread of colored chips. There is an equal amount of pink, green and blue chips, with just a couple less red chips.</li>
			<li>A new legendary Pok&eacute;mon was added, since no Pok&eacute;mon game is ever complete without the presence of Mew!</li>
			<li>Catch rates have been altered. Every color still has a fixed amount of possibilities to catch the Pok&eacute;mon, but the possibilities themselves may vary.</li>
			<li>Some Pok&eacute;mon changed category (chip color) to better reflect their strength and rarity.</li>
			<li>Items and events have been modified to better support other changes or to be more realistic.</li>
			<li>Rivals are now Elite Trainers and they have 5 Pok&eacute;mon instead of just 1. More details cane be found on the <a href="Indigo_Plateau.html">Indigo Plateau</a> page.</li>
			<li>Not all players have to be Ash Ketchum. You can pick between Ash, Misty and Brock.</li>
			<li>Several other small changes, you may notice them while playing...</li>
		</ul>
