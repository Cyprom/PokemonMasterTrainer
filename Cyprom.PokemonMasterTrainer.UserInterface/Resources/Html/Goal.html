		<h1>Goal</h1>
		
		<h2>Power Points</h2>
		<p>
			The goal of the game is to be the first of all players to become a Pok&eacute;mon Master.
			The first step in achieving this goal, is reaching Indigo Plateau.
			A ferry from Cinnabar Island can take you there, provided that you have accumulated at least 20 power points.
			Power points are a Pok&eacute;mon attribute. The big yellow number on the right side of a Pok&eacute;mon chip shows the amount of power points the Pok&eacute;mon has.
			<i>(Example: Gyarados has 7 Power Points)</i>
			<br />Your total amount of power points is the sum of all power points of your Pok&eacute;mon that are fit for battle.
			This means that Pok&eacute;mon that were knocked out in battle and haven't been revived yet, do not add their power points to your total.

		<h2>Beat the Elite</h2>
		<p>
			When you have reached Indigo Plateau, you have to aim for a &quot;BATTLE&quot; space.
			Landing on this space will give you the opportunity to fight against an elite trainer.
			After beating this trainer, you have proven yourself a true Pok&eacute;mon Master and you have won the game.
			For details on the elite battle, go to the <a href="Indigo_Plateau.html">Indigo Plateau</a> instruction page.
